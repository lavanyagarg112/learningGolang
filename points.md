## Six main points

- Statically typed
- Strongly typed (compiler can do better code checking)
- compiled language (v fast compared to interpreted)
- fast compile time
- built in concurrency (go routines)
- simplicity.. has garbage collection as well

## Modules vs packages
- Package is a folder of go files
- Module is a collection of packages

## Compilation and then run
- go build (path to program)
- ./(name of file)

- eg:
- (base) lavanya@Lavanyas-MacBook-Air-2 learningGolang % go build cmd/tut1/main.go
- (base) lavanya@Lavanyas-MacBook-Air-2 learningGolang % ./main


## Run and compile in same line
go run (path to program)
